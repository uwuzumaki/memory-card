### Reflection

I thought this project would take a lot longer to do but it was a lot easier than I thought. Once you breakdown the project into each individual part and understood what you needed to do, it became a lot simpler.

I do think my css skills are not good and I kinda just ripped most of this off from the base react+vite setup.

### Things to add

A possible adjuster to the difficulty of the game (hard with 16 or 25 Pokémon)
